Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesnâ€™t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities, but this happens to be a bad idea.

To avoid this limitations, Hugo created [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/). A shortcode is a simple snippet inside a page.

**Hugo Theme Learn** provides multiple shortcodes on top of existing ones.
